# Accessing images

GridScore will store all the data that is recorded locally and it's able to synchronize it with the GridScore server. Due to the technology we are using for GridScore, this isn't possible for the images that are taken during phenotyping.

Images will be stored on your local device, but they cannot currently be synchronized between devices. Accessing the images on your device works differently depending on whether you use an Android or iOS device. We will explain the basic steps here, but they may differ depending on the version of your operating system or specific device.

## Android

If you're using an Android device, getting your images will be pretty straightforward. Google provides detailed instructions on how to achieve this: https://support.google.com/android/answer/9064445

In the simplest case, plug your phone or tablet into your Windows Pc or Mac with a USB cable and follow the instructions on the link above to copy the images across. They are located in the `Downloads` folder on Android.

## iOS

Transferring the images from iOS isn't quite as straightforward and may depend on whether you have access to cloud storage. Copying via a USB cable isn't easily possible. There are a number of options you can use to transfer your files as listed at the following link by Apple: https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/iphone/iphf2d851b9/ios
